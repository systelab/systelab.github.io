## Mapping model from allure-json/xml to allure-reporter to JAMA

Allure-json/xml Field | Purpose and considerations | JSON/XML Example | JEE | Angular | NUnit| Allure-reporter | JAMA 
--- | --- | --- | --- |--- | --- | --- | --- 
tms | 	Name of the Test Case.It must be the same as the Test Case name in Jama.We highly recommend you not to use the TmsLink for additional traceability purposes. It's better to keep it simple so that it is maintainable | as links field name. See below.  "links": [    {      "name": "TC1234_Formulas",      "type": "tms"    } | @TmsLink("MLG_TC1086_LAB...") | allure.addLabel('tms', tms); | AllureTms | Test Case Name (title) | Test Case Name 
feature | Description of the Test Case. You can also add additional information as text such as preconditions, environment, etc. | as labels field name. See below. "labels": [        {      "name": "feature",      "value": "Goal: This test case is intended to verify the correct calculation of the different Statistical Calculations….\nEnvironment: …\nPreconditions: N\A" }] | @Feature("Goal: This test case is intended to verify...") | allure.addLabel('feature', feature); | AllureFeature | Test Case Additional Information such as Goal, Preconditions or Environment | N/A 
status | Status of the Test Run such as Passed, Blocked or Failed | "status": "passed", | - | - | - | Test Case status icon | Test Run Status
tester | Test Executor as the user name of a CSW employee  | - | - | - | - | - | Test Run Assigned to (The user logged into Jama) 
actualResults | Label actualResults |“labels”:[{ “name”: “actualResults”,  “value”: “Executed all steps with positive results….” | TBD | allure.addLabel('actualResults', version); | - | The Actual Results label is displayed below the Test case Description	| ActualResults field in the Test Run  
steps - actions | Step Action in the Test Case. You must enter the action to perform. |  "steps": [    {      "name": "Perform Login",      "status": "passed",      "stage": "finished",      "start": 1541509690027,      "stop": 1541509697546,      "steps": [        {          "name": "The patient is properly created",          "status": "passed",          "stage": "finished", | @Description("Execute the Performance ...") |  it('Create Allergies', async () => { | Description |  Step Action (2nd column in the table) | N/A                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
steps - expected results or sub-actions | Step Expected Result or Action in the Test Case.You can use Step("Action: ...") to identify that a step is an Action. Otherwise, all the @Steps will be considered as Expected Results.Consider that it may be nested Steps.All the Expected Results are documented just once, for each type of object. | "steps": [    {      "name": "Action: Create 1 patient",      "status": "passed",      "stage": "finished",      "start": 1541509690027,      "stop": 1541509697546,      "steps": [        {          "name": "The patient is properly created",          "status": "passed",          "stage": "finished", | @Step("Field {0} must be {1}") @Step("Action: Perform Login") | await allure.createStep('Number of allergies ...',async () {}(); | - | Step Expected Result or Action in the Test Case (2nd or 3rd column in the table) | N/A 
Other custom Labels |  The intent is to add custom labels to report the version build, tester, test execution date and time. And other information such as the browser. | label name='appVersion' value='Version 1.4 (build 20)'label name=’tester’ value=’opuig’… | TBD | allure.addLabel('appVersion', version); allure.addLabel('tester', user); allure.addLabel('testExecutionDateTime',  new Date().toLocaleString()); | - | All the labels added to the JSON/XML will be displayed below the Test Case Description (after the steps table) | N/A
